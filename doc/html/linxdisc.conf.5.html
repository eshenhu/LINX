linxdisc.conf - custom settings for linxdisc 
<h2><a name='sect1' href='#toc1'>Synopsis</a></h2>
<b>/etc/linxdisc.conf</b>

<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>

<p> This file contains configuration variables for the linxdisc
daemon.  For non-configured variables, default values are used. 
<p> The linxdisc.conf
must be located in the /etc directory,  unless specified when linxdisc
is started. 
<p> The variables are set using this semantics: VALUE="value1 value2
..." 
<p> When the linxdisc daemon catches a SIGHUP, the configuration will be
reread.  IFACE, LINX_NETWORK_NAME and NODE_NAME will not be changed during
runtime,  while  ALLOW and DENY will be applied immediately to close disallowed
 connections and when creating new connections.  
<p> 
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Variables</a></h2>

<dl>

<dt><b>IFACE</b> </dt>
<dd>specifies
what network interface(s) to use. Only real devices are supported.  Several
interfaces can be specified. e.g. IFACE="eth0 eth1".  Default is to use all
available devices. <br>

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>LINX_NETWORK_NAME</b> </dt>
<dd>specifies the name of a LINX cluster. linxdisc only creates
LINX communication links to nodes, advertising the same cluster name. All
nodes must have the linxdisc daemon running. Default is the cluster name
"undefined". <br>

<p>
<p> 
<p> </dd>

<dt><b>NODE_NAME</b> </dt>
<dd>specifies a node name to advertise. It is used by other nodes
to filter against the allow/deny filter chains. It is also used as the recommended
 local link name, when linxdisc in a remote node creates LINX communication
links to this node, as a response to the advertisement. Default node name
is the hostname. Example: NODE_NAME="server1". <br>

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>ALLOW</b> </dt>
<dd>chain. If specified, linxdisc will only accept connections  to nodes
with the specified advertised node names.  Names are given in a string,
separated by spaces. This variable can be set several times in the configuration
file and the names will be concatenated to one ALLOW chain. Example: ALLOW="node1
node2". <br>

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>DENY</b> </dt>
<dd>chain. NOTE: This setting will not have any effect if ALLOW is set.
If DENY is specified instead of ALLOW, linxdisc will allow LINX connections
 to any node, except those with advertised node names listed here.  Names
are given in a string, separated by spaces. This variable can be set several
times in the configuration file and the names will be concatenated to one
DENY chain. <br>

<p> </dd>

<dt><b>PARAM</b> </dt>
<dd>List of parameters to apply to all links created by linxdisc. For
a description of parameters and allowed values, see <a href='linxcfg.1.html'>linxcfg(1)</a>
. This variable
can be set several times in this file and the specified parameters are
concatenated to one PARAM chain. <br>
