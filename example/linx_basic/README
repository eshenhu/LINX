LINX "basic" client/server example application
==============================================

This is a client/server example application using the LINX IPC.

The client(s) and the server may be executed on the same machine or
on different machines interconnected by LINX. 

The client looks up (hunt for) the server, either on a given link or on the
local machine if no <linkname> is provided as argument. When the server
has been found,
a message with signal number REQUEST_SIG is sent. The server answers each incoming
request with a REPLY_SIG to the client.
Upon receiving the reply, the client waits for 2 seconds and then sends the next
request. Each request/reply carries a sequence number to identify
the transaction. The total number of requests to be sent can be
given as an argument when starting the client (the -n option).

The server may be terminated and restarted at any time. The clients
use the LINX attach function to detect if the server disappears and
will resume operation as soon as the server is available again.

The client(s) and the server can be started in any order, and many
clients may be run simultaneously (local or remote). 

Both the client(s) and the server will close down after 30 seconds
of inactivity.



How to build
------------

Build the LINX API library:

   cd <top level LINX directory>
   make lib

Build the example:

   cd <top level LINX directory>
   make example

The build results in two executables:

   example/bin/linx_basic_client
   example/bin/linx_basic_server

See the README in the LINX top level directory for information on
how to build the LINX kernel module and the linxcfg command util.



How to run the example on a single node
---------------------------------------

If the target machine is not the same as the build host, download
the LINX kernel module and the linx_example application to the target
and login as root. Modify the paths below as appropriate.

Install the LINX kernel module:

   insmod net/linx/linx.ko

Start the server (in the background):

   example/bin/linx_example_server &

Start the client (send 10 requests, then terminate):

   example/bin/linx_example_client -n 10



How to run the example on two nodes
-----------------------------------

If the target machines are not the same as the build hosts, download
the LINX kernel module, the linxcfg command and the linx_example
application to the targets and login as root. Modify the paths below
as appropriate.

On each targets, install the LINX kernel and ethernet cm module:

   insmod net/linx/linx.ko
   insmod net/linx/linx_eth_cm.ko

On each target, establish a link using the linxcfg command:

   bin/linxcfg create <remote mac addr> <device(i.e. eth0)> <linkname>

On target 1, start the server:

   example/bin/linx_basic_server

On target 2, start the client (send 10 requests, then terminate):

   example/bin/linx_basic_client -n 10 <linkname>


Example:

   Target 1:

   root@target1> insmod net/linx/linx.ko
   root@target1> insmod net/linx/linx_eth_cm.ko
   root@target1> bin/linxcfg create 00:E0:0C:00:00:FD eth0 target2
   root@target1> example/bin/linx_basic_server

   Target 2:

   root@target2> insmod net/linx/linx.ko
   root@target2> insmod net/linx/linx_eth_cm.ko
   root@target2> bin/linxcfg create 00:30:07:04:02:5E eth0 target1
   root@target2> example/bin/linx_basic_client -n 10 target1
